around 10 variables and 400 records. \n","#The attributes are as follows: \n","# Sales -- Unit sales (in thousands) at each location\n","# Competitor Price -- Price charged by competitor at each location\n","# Income -- Community income level (in thousands of dollars)\n","# Advertising -- Local advertising budget for company at each location (in thousands of dollars)\n","# Population -- Population size in region (in thousands)\n","# Price -- Price company charges for car seats at each site\n","# Shelf Location at stores -- A factor with levels Bad, Good and Medium indicating the quality of the shelving location for the car seats at each site\n","# Age -- Average age of the local population\n","# Education -- Education level at each location\n","# Urban -- A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in an urban or rural location\n","# US -- A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in the US or not\n","#The company dataset looks like this: \n"," \n","#Problem Statement:\n","#A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes causes high sale. \n","#Approach - A decision tree can be built
